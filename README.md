Questions preceded by a * are optional. Although they can be skipped without any deduction, it is important to know and understand the results they contain.

Ex. 1 ‚Äî Hash tables

In this exercise we want to estimate the maximum number of keys per slot we can expect when inserting n keys into n slots of a hash table.

Given a hash table with n slots, n keys are equiprobably hashed to each slot. Let M denote the maximum number of keys in a slot once they have all been inserted.

1. For any positive integer k, show that the probability Pk that exactly k keys hash to a same slot is

                            (n
                            	

                            )
                            	

                            k
                            	

                            (1 ‚àí n
                            	

                            )
                            	

                            n‚àík
                            	

                            (k)
                            	

                            .

                            1
                            		

                            1
                            		

                            n
                            	
                            									

        Prove that the probability Pk‚Ä≤ , for the slot with the most keys to have exactly k keys, is less or equal to nPk .

        Prove that Pk < ek /kk .

* 4. Show that for any positive integer k ‚â• c log n/ log log n, for some constant c > 1, Pk‚Ä≤ < 1/n2.

        Denoting the expected value of M by E (M), observe that

                E (M) ‚â§ Pr (
                	

                M >
                	

                c log n
                	

                ) n + Pr
                	

                (
                	

                M ‚â§
                	

                c log n
                	

                )
                	

                c log n
                	

                ,
                		

                log log n
                	

                log log n
                	

                log log n

    )

    	

    log n

    and conclude that E (M) = O
    		

    .

    log log n

Hint: for question 3 apply Stirling formula.

Ex. 2 ‚Äî Minimum spanning tree

Let G be a graph and T be a minimum spanning tree for G . Write the pseudocode of an algorithm which determines the minimum spanning tree of the graph G when the weight of an edge not in T is decreased.

Ex. 3 ‚Äî Simple algorithms

    1. Given two n-bits integers stored in two arrays, explain how to compute their sum in an n + 1-bits array. Write the corresponding pseudocode.

        One decides to multiply two integers x and y by writing a function mult(x,y) returning 0 if one of them is 0 and otherwise returning the sum of a recursive call on mult, with parameters 2x and

‚åäy/2‚åã, and x ¬∑ (y mod 2).

    Express this algorithm as pseudo-code.

    Prove the correctness of this algorithm.

Ex. 4 ‚Äî Problem

Given twenty five horses determine the three fastest ones, in the right order, knowing that no more than five can race at a time. What is the minimum number of races necessary? Detail a general algorithm which solves the problem.

Ex. 5 ‚Äî Critical thinking

        The Knapsack problem is defined as follows. Given a set S and a number n find a subset of S whose elements add up exactly to n. Which of the following algorithms solve the Knapsack problem?

            Fit the knapsack with the smallest items first.

            Fit the knapsack with the largest items first.

* 2. In the course (Example 1.??) it is mentioned that m should be ‚Äúa prime not too close from a power of 2‚Äù in order for the hash function H(k) = k mod m to be a good choice. Explain.

        Provide an example of a greedy algorithm which is locally optimal while not being globally optimal. Provide all the necessary details to support your claim.
